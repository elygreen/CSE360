CSE 360 Monday Class

This is the file folder for Individual Assignment 3 for CSE 360.
I've only included the files that have been changed for HW3 as opposed
to every file of the project to make it clearer what has been changed.
Every other file not included is identical to the Foundational Code
provided in class.

/doc/ contains the Javadoc html output for the changes made in HW3.
/src//application/ contains the java files for the actual program.
For this assignment, I created QuestionAnswerTestMainline.java and
AutomatedTestCaseQuestionAnswer.java to run the automated test cases
and these are the only new / changed files. The Javadoc is provided
in these files with the output html in /doc/.
